Livestock Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project involves building a Livestock Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. The model predicts future prices of livestock commodities based on historical price data obtained from Yahoo Finance.

Features
Linear Regression Model: A straightforward and effective algorithm for predicting continuous variables, applied here to forecast livestock prices.
Yahoo Finance Integration: Historical price data is fetched using Yahoo Finance API.
Visualization: Graphical representation of historical prices, predicted prices, and error metrics.
Scalable: Easily adaptable to different livestock commodities or timeframes.
Data Source
The historical price data for the livestock commodities (e.g., cattle, hogs, sheep) is sourced from Yahoo Finance. The data includes:

Date
Open Price
High Price
Low Price
Close Price
Adjusted Close Price
Volume
Model Training
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Training Data: Historical price data from Yahoo Finance is used to train the model.
Feature Selection: Features include previous prices and other time-series data to predict future prices.
Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
